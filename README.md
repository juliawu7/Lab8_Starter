**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**
Service workers support graceful degradation by allowing apps to still function and work even without an internet connection. Graceful degradation refers to when we first design, we assume the best-case scenario in which we have max technology and then design contingencies for older systems later, like poor internet connection. Service workers are an example of these contingencies as they allow the user to still access functionality and content when network is not available.
